## Positioning (One-liner)

> Your personal AI assistant, everywhere you message. Self-hosted. Model-agnostic. 14+ channels.

---

## Core Differentiators

1. **14+ channel support** -- No other personal AI assistant covers this many messaging platforms from a single gateway.
2. **Self-hosted, local-first** -- Gateway runs on user hardware. Credentials and conversations never leave the device.
3. **Model-agnostic** -- Use any AI provider (Anthropic, OpenAI, Bedrock, Ollama) with automatic failover.
4. **Full agent runtime** -- Browser control, cron automation, multi-agent routing, skills ecosystem, and voice interaction.
5. **Open source (MIT)** -- Fully auditable, extensible, and community-driven.
